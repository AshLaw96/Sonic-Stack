Feature-by-Feature Testing:

- Navigation: I ensured smooth transitions between each page and the links direct to the correct destination.
- Responsive Design: I've checked for compatibility across multiple devices and screen sizes.
- Portfolio Display: I have verified that every page is properly showcased with accurate descriptions, images, and links.
- Game area: I confirmed that the game worked as intended on different devices and screen sizes.
- Buttons: I made sure that all buttons worked as they should and were easy to understand and read.

User Experience Testing:

- Usability Testing: I let users interact with my site and provide feedback of their experience with it.
1.
2.
3.
- Accessibility Testing: I confirmed compliance with accessibility standards e.g. screen reader compatibility, proper alt text for images and keyboard navigation.

Compatibility Testing:

- Browser Compatibility: I Tested on different browsers, to ensure compatible performance.
- Device Compatibility: I ensured functionality across numerous devices.
- Performance Testing:
  - Speed and Load Testing: I used PageSpeed Insights to check page load times and optimized where necessary.

  - Scalability Testing: I assessed how the site handled increased traffic and usage.

Regression Testing:

After implementing any fixes or updates I ensured that previous features and functionalities still worked as intended.

Documentation and Logs:

- whilst creating the blocks, I noticed that where the blocks appeared the box shadow stayed when they left the area.

  - The issue: [issue](documentation/bugs/box-shadow-issue.png)

- To fix this issue I needed to add code into the correct function that removed the box shadow style.

  - The fix: [fix](documentation/bugs/fix-shadow.png)

- Whilst creating the rules hide button, I noticed that it wouldn't show and hide the text as desired.

  - The issue: [issue](documentation/bugs/display-type-issue.png)

- To fix this I had to remove multiple `span` elements inside the button element.
  
  - The fix: [fix](documentation/bugs/display-type-fix.png)

- Whilst creating the blocks, I noticed that the blocks were not in the correct designed shapes.

  - The issue: [issue](documentation/bugs/misshaped.png)

- To fix the issue, I had to change the game areas width and height so each div would fit evenly in the game area.

  - The fix: [fix](documentation/bugs/fix-misshaped.png)

- When creating the game, I noticed that when moving the blocks all way left or right of the game area, it would overlap to the opposite side of the game area.

  - The issue: [issue](documentation/bugs/overlap-right.png)

- To fix this issue, I had to add a function that checked if the block had reached the edge of the game area and if so stop.

  - The fix: [fix](documentation/bugs/fix-overlap-right.png)

- When trying to select all the `div` inside the game area I came across a type error.

  - The issue: [issue](documentation/bugs/type-error.png)

- To fix this issue I used the `querySelectorAll` to get all the child elements inside the game area.

  - The fix: [fix](documentation/bugs/fix-type-error.png)

- Whilst testing the game, I noticed that when turning the blocks near the edge of the game area they would overlap to the other side of the game area.

  - The issue: [issue](documentation/bugs/turn-overlap-screen.png)

- To fix the issue, I had to add a function that implemented code when the block turned near the edge of the game area, move its location away so it didn't overlap the game area.

  - The fix: [fix](documentation/bugs/turn-overlap-fix.png)

User Feedback Incorporation:

If applicable, mention how user feedback has been taken into account and implemented to enhance the user experience.

## Defensive Programming

ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘-START OF NOTES (to be deleted)

Defensive programming (defensive design) is extremely important!

When building projects that accept user inputs or forms, you should always test the level of security for each.
Examples of this could include (not limited to):

Forms:
- Users cannot submit an empty form
- Users must enter valid email addresses

PP3 (Python-only):
- Users must enter a valid letter/word/string when prompted
- Users must choose from a specific list only

MS3 (Flask) | MS4/PP4/PP5 (Django):
- Users cannot brute-force a URL to navigate to a restricted page
- Users cannot perform CRUD functionality while logged-out
- User-A should not be able to manipulate data belonging to User-B, or vice versa
- Non-Authenticated users should not be able to access pages that require authentication
- Standard users should not be able to access pages intended for superusers

You'll want to test all functionality on your application, whether it's a standard form,
or uses CRUD functionality for data manipulation on a database.
Make sure to include the `required` attribute on any form-fields that should be mandatory.
Try to access various pages on your site as different user types (User-A, User-B, guest user, admin, superuser).

You should include any manual tests performed, and the expected results/outcome.

Testing should be replicable.
Ideally, tests cases should focus on each individual section of every page on the website.
Each test case should be specific, objective, and step-wise replicable.

Instead of adding a general overview saying that everything works fine,
consider documenting tests on each element of the page
(ie. button clicks, input box validation, navigation links, etc.) by testing them in their happy flow,
and also the bad/exception flow, mentioning the expected and observed results,
and drawing a parallel between them where applicable.

Consider using the following format for manual test cases:

Expected Outcome / Test Performed / Result Received / Fixes Implemented

- **Expected**: "Feature is expected to do X when the user does Y."
- **Testing**: "Tested the feature by doing Y."
- (either) **Result**: "The feature behaved as expected, and it did Y."
- (or) **Result**: "The feature did not respond to A, B, or C."
- **Fix**: "I did Z to the code because something was missing."

Use the table below as a basic start, and expand on it using the logic above.

Defensive programming was manually tested with the below user acceptance testing:

Another way of performing defensive testing is a simple Pass/Fail for each test.
The assessors prefer the above method, with the full test explained, but this is also acceptable in most cases.

When in doubt, use the above method instead, and delete the table below.

## User Story Testing

ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘-START OF NOTES (to be deleted)

Testing user stories is actually quite simple, once you've already got the stories defined on your README.

Most of your project's **features** should already align with the **user stories**,
so this should as simple as creating a table with the user story, matching with the re-used screenshot
from the respective feature.

## Bugs

ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘-START OF NOTES (to be deleted)

This section is primarily used for JavaScript and Python applications,
but feel free to use this section to document any HTML/CSS bugs you might run into.

It's very important to document any bugs you've discovered while developing the project.
Make sure to include any necessary steps you've implemented to fix the bug(s) as well.

**PRO TIP**: screenshots of bugs are extremely helpful, and go a long way!

## Unfixed Bugs

ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘-START OF NOTES (to be deleted)

You will need to mention unfixed bugs and why they were not fixed.
This section should include shortcomings of the frameworks or technologies used.
Although time can be a big variable to consider, paucity of time and difficulty understanding
implementation is not a valid reason to leave bugs unfixed.

If you've identified any unfixed bugs, no matter how small, be sure to list them here.
It's better to be honest and list them, because if it's not documented and an assessor finds the issue,
they need to know whether or not you're aware of them as well, and why you've not corrected/fixed them.

Some examples:

ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘-END OF NOTES (to be deleted)

- On devices smaller than 375px, the page starts to have `overflow-x` scrolling.

    ![screenshot](documentation/bugs/unfixed-bug01.png)

    - Attempted fix: I tried to add additional media queries to handle this, but things started becoming too small to read.

- For PP3, when using a helper `clear()` function, any text above the height of the terminal does not clear, and remains when you scroll up.

    ![screenshot](documentation/bugs/unfixed-bug02.png)

    - Attempted fix: I tried to adjust the terminal size, but it only resizes the actual terminal, not the allowable area for text.

- When validating HTML with a semantic `section` element, the validator warns about lacking a header `h2-h6`. This is acceptable.

    ![screenshot](documentation/bugs/unfixed-bug03.png)

    - Attempted fix: this is a known warning and acceptable, and my section doesn't require a header since it's dynamically added via JS.
