Sonic Stack is a Tetris game with a Sonic design. This is to draw all those Sonic and Tetris lovers all into one awesome box.

When users visit the website they will be able to quickly find the difficulty level they want to start their gaming session and then easily start Tetrissing away. The demographic for the website is anyone that loves old school gaming, anyone that loves Sonic and anyone that enjoys Tetris. It is perfect for all ages and can be played alone our with others.

## UX

Sonic Stacks purpose is to help resolve peoples lack of enthusiasm by giving them fun tasks to solve.

The site will have 3 pages, the first page will contain the easy level game area, then the medium game area and finally the hard game area. Each page will comprise with the same layout so the user can easily navigate through the site.

### Colour Scheme

- The design of the Tetris game will incorporate both the slick colours from Sonic and old school styles from Tetris.
  - `#FFFFFF` used for primary text.
  - `#000000` used for main background.
  - `#3061E3` used for blocks.
  - `#1F51FF` used for shadows.
  - `#FF3131` used for blocks.
  - `#FF0000` used for shadows.
  - `#FFBF00` used for blocks.
  - `#F9D71C` used for shadows.

I used [coolors.co](https://coolors.co/ffffff-3061e3-ff3131-ffbf00-1f51ff-ff0000-f9d71c-000000) to generate my colour palette.

![screenshot](documentation/colours.png)

I've used CSS `:root` variables to easily update the global colour scheme by changing only one value, instead of everywhere in the CSS file.

```css
:root {
    /* P = Primary | S = Shadow */
    --p-text: #FFFFFF;
    --p-highlight: #000000;
    --p-block1: #3061E3;
    --p-block2: #FF3131;
    --p-block3: #FFBF00;
    --s-block1: #1F51FF;
    --s-block2: #FF0000;
    --s-block3: #F9D71C;
}
```

### Typography

- [Square Mile](https://www.fontget.com/font/square-mile/) was used for all the text.

- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com) icons were used throughout the site, such as the icons in the navigation dropdown.

## Wireframes

To follow best practice, wireframes were developed for mobile, tablet, and desktop sizes.
I've used [Moqups](https://app.moqups.com) to design my site wireframes.
