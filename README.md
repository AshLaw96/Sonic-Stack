Sonic Stack is a Tetris game with a Sonic design. This is to draw all those Sonic and Tetris lovers all into one awesome box.

When users visit the website they will be able to quickly find the difficulty level they want to start their gaming session and then easily start Tetrissing away. The demographic for the website is anyone that loves old school gaming, anyone that loves Sonic and anyone that enjoys Tetris. It is perfect for all ages and can be played alone our with others.

## UX

Sonic Stacks purpose is to help resolve peoples lack of enthusiasm by giving them fun tasks to solve.

The site will have 3 pages, the first page will contain the easy level game area, then the medium game area and finally the hard game area. Each page will comprise with the same layout so the user can easily navigate through the site.

### Colour Scheme

- The design of the Tetris game will incorporate both the slick colours from Sonic and old school styles from Tetris.
  - `#FFFFFF` used for primary text.
  - `#000000` used for main background.
  - `#3061E3` used for blocks.
  - `#1F51FF` used for shadows.
  - `#FF3131` used for blocks.
  - `#FF0000` used for shadows.
  - `#FFBF00` used for blocks.
  - `#F9D71C` used for shadows.

I used [coolors.co](https://coolors.co/ffffff-3061e3-ff3131-ffbf00-1f51ff-ff0000-f9d71c-000000) to generate my colour palette.

⚠️ ONLY IF YOU ACTUALLY ADDED `:root` variables in CSS! ⚠️
If you've used CSS `:root` variables, consider also including a code snippet here!

🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑-END OF NOTES (to be deleted)

I've used CSS `:root` variables to easily update the global colour scheme by changing only one value, instead of everywhere in the CSS file.

```css
:root {
    /* P = Primary | S = Secondary */
    --p-text: #000000;
    --p-highlight: #E84610;
    --s-text: #4A4A4F;
    --s-highlight: #009FE3;
    --white: #FFFFFF;
    --black: #000000;
}
```

### Typography

🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑START OF NOTES (to be deleted)

Explain any fonts and icon libraries used, like Google Fonts and/or Font Awesome.

Consider adding a link to each font used, and the Font Awesome site if used (or similar icon library).

Example:

🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑-END OF NOTES (to be deleted)

- [Montserrat](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat) was used for the primary headers and titles.

- [Lato](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lato) was used for all other secondary text.

- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com) icons were used throughout the site, such as the social media icons in the footer.

## Wireframes

🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑 START OF NOTES (to be deleted)

In this section, display your wireframe screenshots using a Markdown `table`.
Instructions on how to do Markdown `tables` start on line #213 on this site: https://pandao.github.io/editor.md/en.html

Alternatively, dropdowns are a way to condense several wireframes into a collapsible menu to save space.
Dropdowns in Markdown are considered some of the only acceptable HTML components that are allowed for assessment purposes.

⚠️ **IMPORTANT**! ⚠️ **IMPORTANT**! ⚠️ **IMPORTANT**! ⚠️
The example below uses the `details` and `summary` code elements.
However, for these scripts to work, I've had to add spaces within the `< >` elements.

You MUST remove these spaces for it to work properly on your own README/TESTING files.
Remove the spaces within the `< >` brackets for the `details` and `summary` code elements,
for the Mobile, Tablet, and Desktop wireframes.

🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑-END OF NOTES (to be deleted)

To follow best practice, wireframes were developed for mobile, tablet, and desktop sizes.
I've used [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/wireframes) to design my site wireframes.
